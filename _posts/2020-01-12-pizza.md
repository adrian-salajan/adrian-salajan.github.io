## Strong typing
I'm a believer in strong & static typing. A good type is like a math equation - just as an equation describes the equalities and how 
they change, the possibilities of interactions, a type describes the invariants and the properties of what the type represents.
Good types allow us to make invalid states unrepresentable in code, transforming runtime bugs into compiler errors.

## Pizza
Most of use like pizza. Simplistically to make one we need to first flatten some dough,
add the base sauce, add the topping and cook it. It is important to follow all these steps and
in the right order. If we don't follow these steps we get something which is not a pizza.  
We will build an API for making pizza and we will try to design it such that the clients of the API
can make pizzas even if they are not cooks (may forget steps or do them in the wrong order) - they will be forced to follow all the steps, else the code won't compile.

## Generic Pizza recipe
To make pizza we need to first flatten some dough,
add the base sauce, add the topping and cook it.
We will model the steps with an ADT (Algebraic Data Type).

{% highlight scala %}

sealed trait MakePizzaStep extends Product with Serializable
case class SetupDough(size: Int) extends MakePizzaStep
case object AddSauce extends MakePizzaStep
case class AddTopping(topping: String) extends MakePizzaStep
case object Cook extends MakePizzaStep

{% endhighlight %}

After each of the steps we get an unfinished pizza, and only following all the steps we get a finished pizza. 
We model these intermediary results with another ADT

{% highlight scala %}

sealed trait Pizza
case class FinishedPizza(size: Int, topping: String) extends Pizza

sealed trait UnfinishedPizza extends Pizza
object NoPizza extends UnfinishedPizza
case class Base(size: Int) extends UnfinishedPizza
case class BaseWithSauce(size: Int) extends UnfinishedPizza
case class Uncooked(size: Int, topping: String) extends UnfinishedPizza

{% endhighlight %}

To make pizza we are left to implement the function which will read the steps and make the pizza. These functions
reading ADTs and implementing the behavior are called interpreters.
The interpreter's result will be either a FinishedPizza or if the steps provided are in the wrong order or incomplete
it will return a PizzaError.

{% highlight scala %}

final case class PizzaError(description: String)

def makePizza(steps: List[MakePizzaStep]): Either[PizzaError, FinishedPizza] = {
    val pendingPizza = steps.foldLeft(NoPizza.asRight[PizzaError].widen[Pizza]) {
        case (Right(NoPizza), SetupDough(size)) => Base(size).asRight
        case (Right(Base(size)), AddSauce) => BaseWithSauce(size).asRight
        case (Right(BaseWithSauce(size)), AddTopping(topping)) => Uncooked(size, topping).asRight
        case (Right(Uncooked(size, topping)), _: Cook.type) => FinishedPizza(size, topping).asRight
        case (e: Left[_,_], _) => e
        case _ => PizzaError("bad instructions").asLeft[FinishedPizza]
}

    pendingPizza match {
      case Left(e) => e.asLeft[FinishedPizza]
      case Right(_: UnfinishedPizza) => PizzaError("bad instructions").asLeft[FinishedPizza]
      case Right(p: FinishedPizza) => p.asRight
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Our API is now complete in the sense that we can make pizzas by following pizza recipes.

{% highlight scala %}

test("make pizza") {
    val steps = List(SetupDough(2), AddSauce, AddTopping("mushrooms"), Cook)

    val mediumMushroomPizza = TypeOrder.makePizza(steps)

    inside (mediumMushroomPizza) {
      case Left(e) => Assertions.fail(e.description)
      case Right(pizza) => Assertions.assert(pizza == FinishedPizza(2, "mushrooms"))
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

But it is also very error prone, since the user of the API needs to know details about how pizza is made, else he will get a pizza error.
He needs to know to build the list with all the steps and in the right order before passing it to makePizza().
It would be best if the API would be safer to use such that the user will be guided in making valid pizzas.
Our API will provide a PizzaRecipeBuilder. It will have the responsibility of building the recipes in the right order.
We start with a definition which let's us build recipes like this:

{% highlight scala %}

val recipe = 
  PizzaRecipeBuilder(SetupDough(2))
    .andThen(AddSauce)
    .andThen(AddTopping("mushrooms"))
    .andThen(Cook)
    .recipe

{% endhighlight %}  
{% highlight scala %}

sealed class PizzaRecipeBuilder[A <: MakePizzaStep](head: A) { that =>
    protected val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = List(head)

    def steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = _steps.reverse

    def andThen[B <: MakePizzaStep](nextStep: B): PizzaRecipeBuilder[B] =
      new PizzaRecipeBuilder(nextStep) {
        override val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = nextStep :: that._steps
      }
}

{% endhighlight %}

This is just the starting point since with it we can still build invalid recipes.

{% highlight scala %}

test("pizza builder  - wrong ordering") {
  val recipe = PizzaRecipeBuilder(SetupDough(2))
    //Woops! we are forgetting the Sauce
    .andThen(AddTopping("mushrooms")) 
    .andThen(Cook)
    .recipe

  val pizza = TypeOrder.makePizza(recipe)

  inside(pizza) {
    case Left(e) => Assertions.fail(e.description)
    case Right(p) => Assertions.assert(p == FinishedPizza(2, "mushrooms"))
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

We need to enforce the builder to only add valid next steps given it's current state.
We will use implicits and typeclasses for this. We will define a RecipeTransition[A, B] typeclass
which will be a required implicit parameter to andThen(). We will then enforce correct ordering by implementing only those RecipeTransitions which we want to allow.


{% highlight scala %}

sealed class PizzaRecipeBuilder[A <: MakePizzaStep](firstStep: A) { that =>
  protected val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = List(firstStep)

  def steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = _steps.reverse

  def andThen[B <: MakePizzaStep](nextStep: B)(implicit ev: RecipeTransition[A, B]): PizzaRecipeBuilder[B] =
    new PizzaRecipeBuilder(nextStep) {
      override val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = nextStep :: that._steps
    }
}

sealed trait RecipeTransition[A <: MakePizzaStep, B <: MakePizzaStep]  

object RecipeTransition {
  implicit val addSauceAfterDough: RecipeTransition[SetupDough, AddSauce.type] =
    new RecipeTransition[SetupDough, AddSauce.type] {}  

  implicit val addToppingAfterSauce: RecipeTransition[AddSauce.type, AddTopping] =
    new RecipeTransition[AddSauce.type , AddTopping] {}  

  implicit val cookAfterTopping: RecipeTransition[AddTopping, Cook.type] =
    new RecipeTransition[AddTopping, Cook.type] {}
}

{% endhighlight %}

Now our test won't compile, as it is forcing us to add the sauce

{% highlight scala %}

test("pizza builder  - wrong ordering") {
  val recipe = PizzaRecipeBuilder(SetupDough(2))
    .andThen(AddTopping("mushrooms")) 
    // Compile error: could not find implicit value for parameter ev: RecipeTransition[SetupDough,AddSauce.type]
    .andThen(Cook)
    .recipe

  val pizza = TypeOrder.makePizza(recipe)

  inside(pizza) {
    case Left(e) => Assertions.fail(e.description)
    case Right(p) => Assertions.assert(p == FinishedPizza(2, "mushrooms"))
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

The design up to here forces us to define the recipe in the correct order but it still has 2 issue.
Even though the sequence might be correct, we might forget some last steps, like Cooking,
or we might forget the first steps, like setting up the dough

{% highlight scala %}

val uncookedPizza = PizzaRecipeBuilder(SetupDough(2))
  .andThen(AddSauce)
  .andThen(AddTopping("mushrooms"))
  .recipe

val notEvenAMargherita= PizzaRecipeBuilder(AddSauce)
  .andThen(AddTopping("mushrooms"))
  .andThen(Cook)
  .recipe

{% endhighlight %}

To fix this we need to do a few things. First we will only allow calling recipe on a PizzaRecipeBuilder[Cook] since this is the last step
and guarantees we have all the steps.
We can do this by defining a new typeclass FinalStep[A] with a single implementation FinalStep[Cook] and require it on the recipe function,
but instead we will use the more suggestive Is[A, B] typeclass from Cats.

{% highlight scala %}

import cats.evidence.===
def recipe(implicit ev: A === Cook.type): List[MakePizzaStep] = _steps.reverse

{% endhighlight %}

Second, we can not allow starting the recipe from an intermediary step. We will create an apply method in the companion object with implicit parameters
that accepts only the correct first pizza recipe step (SetupDough), and we make the constructor private - this accepts every step and we need it to make the transition from a PizzaRecipeBuilder[A] to PizzaRecipeBuilder[B].

{% highlight scala %}

sealed class PizzaRecipeBuilder[A <: MakePizzaStep] private(firstStep: A) { that =>
    protected val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = List(firstStep)

    def recipe(implicit ev: A === Cook.type): List[MakePizzaStep] = _steps.reverse

    def andThen[B <: MakePizzaStep](nextStep: B)(implicit ev: RecipeTransition[A, B]): PizzaRecipeBuilder[B] =
      new PizzaRecipeBuilder(nextStep) {
        override val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = nextStep :: that._steps
      }
}

object PizzaRecipeBuilder {
  def apply[A <: MakePizzaStep](a: A)(implicit ev: A === SetupDough) = new PizzaRecipeBuilder[A](a)
}

{% endhighlight %}

Having all this we can go ahead and make makePizza private because we will wrap it with a safe pizza method and offer this instead to the client to build pizza

{% highlight scala %}

sealed class PizzaRecipeBuilder[A <: MakePizzaStep] private(firstStep: A) { that =>
    protected val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = List(firstStep)

def recipe(implicit ev: A === Cook.type): PizzaRecipe = new PizzaRecipe(_steps.reverse)

def andThen[B <: MakePizzaStep](nextStep: B)(implicit ev: RecipeTransition[A, B]): PizzaRecipeBuilder[B] =
  new PizzaRecipeBuilder(nextStep) {
    override val _steps: List[MakePizzaStep] = nextStep :: that._steps
  }
}

object PizzaRecipeBuilder {
  def apply[A <: MakePizzaStep](a: A)(implicit ev: A === SetupDough) = new PizzaRecipeBuilder[A](a)
}

def makePizzaSafe(steps: PizzaRecipe): FinishedPizza = {
    makePizza(steps.list).toOption.get //safe due to our PizzaRecipeBuilder/Recipe guarantees
}

{% endhighlight %}

With this the API client can only make FinishedPizza(s)! no error is possible.

---
  
\* Transforming an Either to an Option and calling get on it is a cheat. In the small context of makePizzaSafe
there is no type guarantee that this won't fail - but in the larger context of the API we know the user of the client can build
only correct PizzaRecipe(s).  
Given the safe PizzaRecipeBuilder, we should be able to rewrite makePizza without involving Either/PizzaError but the tricky part
is telling it to only accept a valid list of MakePizzaStep. Probably the solution would be to use Shapeless HList which remembers the types for each element
together with the RecipeTransition typeclass as evidence (implicits) that the order is correct.
I'm not familiar enough with Shapeless so I leave it for another time.
